# Tracing-people-with-Facial-Recognition-using-OCR
A computer vision project to develop a query based software that seeks string of words as input. It searches through the database using concepts of OCR by employing libraries like Tesseract and OpenCV to find the said string. The program then recognises the faces of individuals on the page, crops them, and arranges them in a strip to display.
